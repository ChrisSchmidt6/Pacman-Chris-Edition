# Pacman-Chris-Edition
My own version of Pacman built from scratch using javascript for a class when I was a highschool senior

The mapmaker folder is a separate page where if you open it you can create maps by clicking to create walls and shift-clicking to delete them. Once done you can click the button at the top to generate an array that when pasted in script.js (if done right) should be a functional map. I only added this so that my friends could make maps to play when I created this in highschool.

Depending on which browser you play this in you may need to tweak the speed because it seems to differ based on your browser

I used jQuery to save time and a pathfinding API called easystar.js (https://easystarjs.com/) to get the "enemies" to move around

All you need to do to play locally is download the files and open index.html
